## General Information
This project was created as an Annivesary gift. It is intended to be a better looking led controller that gives the user full control over their lights. The HSV color selector provides a beautiful compact widget for fully controlling the Leds. An Animator mode allows the user to plot HSV values over a given period. This can be done either by drawing functions directly on the graph or by entering a mathematical function. Additionally, a music mode and scheduling mode are in the works which would allow the lights to 'dance' rhythmically to music and allow light settings for various times of day.
